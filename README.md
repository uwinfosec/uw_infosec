# uw_infosec

The purpose of this repository is to be a unified, single source for instruction materials for courses relating to the **Information Assurance and Cybersecurity** (IAC) track of the Informatics Major at University of Washington.  This repo contains documentation for all coursework, labs, homeworks, and instruction materials for use by instructors and students to facilitate the running of these classes.

## Who owns this repo?
This repo is owned and operated by the head of the UW Infosec Advisory Council, which exists to oversee this repo and to ensure that the coursework and materials for the IAC track remain current and relevant.  The current head of the Council is **Andrew McKenna (amckenna@uw.edu)**

## Use Policy
This repo may be used by any student or instructor associated with the University of Washington.

#### Use as an instructor:
Instructors using this repo to gather course materials to facilitate their classroom are free to use whatever resources are here.  The design of the repo is such that each course is modular - a given course is made out of individual 2 hour lectures and their associated labs and coursework, and completed courses are available with a "default" set of modules that form a total class.  Instructors may pick and choose as they wish from multiple historical iterations of a given course, combine modules from past courses with current ones, or configure their courses in any way that is most useful to run their class.

#### Use as a Student:
University of Washington Students in IAC classes may use this repo in order to acquire materials and resources to complete their coursework as their instructor permits and asks.  As well, students may contribute new modules to the repo that may be used in future courses.

#### Contributing new materials:
Instructors, students, TAs or other people associated with the University of Washington or the UW Infosec Advisory Council may contribute new modules in order to ensure that the courses remain relevant and useful to students in perpetuity.  Contributions should follow the same format as the rest of the repo, and should be done in the form of 2 hour "modules" such that they may be integrated into existing courses more easily.

#### Who made this repo?
This repo and the UW Infosec Advisory Council were formed as an Informatics Capstone project in 2018 by **Sean Yeager**, **Carson McBride**, **Changhwan Oh**, and **Belinda Nanggala** in an effort to refresh the IAC track and ensure its effectiveness and longevity in the future.
